There are two main approaches towards explaining integrals, both of which are valid. 3Blue1Brown explains the pratical and theoretical method of understanding integrals better than anyone else could:

The theoritcal way of looking at integrals is very important (second half of the video). I recommend looking at integrals this way after you fully understand what an integral means, as this way of looking at math is extremely important when you move onto fourier and laplace transformations in your later years.
